# Kaggle: Titanic
First experimentation with machine learning, Jupyter Notebook and a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). 


The [notebook](https://github.com/limphilip/kaggle-titanic/blob/master/kaggle_titanic_notebook.ipynb) contains a first draft
of data exploration, data engineering and machine learning. The model is not finialized and further work should be done in
order to optimize it, but the purpose of this project was to have a first hands-on project in machine learning using common
tools and libraries.
